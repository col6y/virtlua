# virtlua

This is a library designed to be used by computer games that want to embed semi-realistic computers. It provides an
implementation of Lua suitable for use in such scenarios. It should be 100% safe against any internal attacks except
memory-based denial-of-service attacks, though no guarantees are provided.

This is an in-progress work. If it sounds interesting, and you'd like to use it, file an issue and I'll write some
documentation.

This is primarily used by the game [Cosmic Drift](https://github.com/cosmicdrift/cosmicdrift/), which is the only
example of how to use this library, at least for now.
